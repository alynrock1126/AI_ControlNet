Below is a self-contained, illustrative PyTorch example where a small network learned to generate a Subdivision (Sub-D) control cage (fixed quad topology, 
AI predicted vertex positions). It trained on synthetic “target shapes” (ellipsoids with a bump), 
and exported the predicted control cage as an OBJ (quads kept). This is the OBJ file it made
